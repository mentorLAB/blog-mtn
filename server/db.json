            "text": "Hello.\n\n I'd like to tell the story of Farmer Brenny, and his cow.\n\n Years ago, in the land and time of St. Siaosi, there lived a man named Mr. Brenny. This man was a young peddler, who's only desire was to become a merchant. Though fortune did not always smile upon him, he felt deep within his heart that someday, he would do great things.\n\n On the ten and seventh day, of the seventh month, in the Year of our Lord, two thousand and seventeen, Mr. Brenny's life was about to change. He did not know this, but on this very day, he would meet Mrs. Anne Drue.\n\n Mrs. Drue was a quaint individual, who was looking for someone to run her family's farm, so that she could travel the world. Upon meeting Mr. Brenny, Anne knew that her search was over.\n\n Anne decided to approach Brennys uncle, Lord Lloyd of Alans Mill, with the intent to hire Brenny for the next seven years. Upon signing the contract, Anne and Mr. Brenny were on their way.\n\n Seven years hence, our young adventurers Anne and Mr. Brenny decided to part ways, after the Kings Captain, Lt. Jaime Robberson moved the battleground of the war to their old-town farm.\n\n\nThe end.",

Report your suspicions to Jeremy, and provide tinfoil hats for th eboth of you so the alien won't figure it out. \n\n. Ask them if they ate a strange food for breakfast. Aliens, attempting to blend in, will probably say yes. \n\n\n. Create a website that requires them to login and give them the username \"Alien\", and see if they react. If they react then they are an Alien. If they scream at the mention of 'React', then they are probably just an Angular-biased person. \n\n\n\n. Pepper them with questions about their life growing up on Earth. If they get nervous, report them to NASA immediately.",

Life move on.\n\n Beyond these events, something life-changing occured in a small recording studio in a small town. The title: Never Gonna Give You Up.\n\n This song, the solo debut single of singer/song-writer Rick Astley would quickly change the way we browse the internet. \n\n Forever.\n\n Fast-forward to the year 2007. The month was May. The location was 4chan. The clickbait a trailer for the hit video game GTA 4.\n\n Within a year, this viral internet practice quickly gained notice from mainstream media, having reports from magazines like Wired.\n\n In conclusion to this article, we advise all viewers to take caution. You'll never know where Rick will strike, and you'll never truly be prepared.\n\n With the birth of the rick roll, came the death of us all.",

I spent many nights wishing on the stars about being home around the Bluegrass, and Kentucky Basketball. It has been a long time since i smelled the sweet scent of HoneySuckle or the sound of horses thundering around the track at Churchill Downs. It has been quite the journey from KY to UT, but one that will not be forgotten. The knowledge bestowed upon me by Brennon, Lloyd, and the long lost Alan will stay with me till the end of time, and for that i am forever grateful. Their guiding spirit has brought me from the dpeths of unknown coding, and stupid questions, to a somewhat knowledgeable coder. For that i am ever thankful. ",

            "text": "The news crew came to film an interview with Tyler the creator (of DevMountain) and set up the cameras in our classroom. They shot the interview in front of my desk. With the lights in my eyes, I tried to focus on my work and not look directly into the camera. I put on my best poker face, sat up straight and did my work. After they finished the interview, the camera guy came up to me and asked if he could record me typing on my laptop to get a sound byte for their segment. I reluctantly agreed, even though I hate being recorded. He told everyone to be quiet and put the camera really close to my hands. I instantly forgot every single word in the English language and started typing gibberish, really hoping that he wasn't filming my computer screen, which currently looked like, ';al;sdjfaeia;lsdkfa;kea;aosiefa;nfa;esjf'. I thought I heard him say, 'Can you please type louder?' So I started pounding on my keyboard, while still not typing any actual words. Apparently I had been making a face showing my discomfort because, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a group of people watching me, doubled over in silent laughter. At this point, I also realized that the camera man had asked me to type more distinctly, and not louder, because I was still very apparently typing gibberish. After an awkward minute of silence, a large camera pointed at my hands, and an annoyed camera man not getting the shot he wanted because I was still not typing any more distinctly, the camera crew left. I really hope they don't use any of those shots. I don't know if I could handle the fame that comes with the skill of awkwardly typing in a silent, brightly lit classroom.",

I recommend you say \"either\" before the choices, or the one you prefer.\n\nWhen someone asks you to do several things don't assume that the conditionals are always linked to the entire list.\n\nThe term \"while\" is very similar to what you are familiar with in your programming background, however, you never assume that the condition given with the while is permanent.\n\"While you are out ...\" !== while(youAreOut = true) {//actions here}\n\n\"While you are out ...\" === while(youAreOut === true) {//actions here}\n\nRemember, you are multilingual now and you are going to have a \"fun\" time learning the quirks and syntax of this language and the accompaning APIs (Another-Person Interface).\n\nP.S.
