# Http-afternoon Project

## Setup
First you will want to fork and clone this repo and install the neccissary npm packages.

#### Fork and Clone
In your terminal navigate to the folder that will contain this afternoon project.Then clone the repo with this command:

`git clone https://github.com/DevMountain/http-afternoon`

Next cd into the new project folder:
`cd http-afternoon`

Then you will need to install the required react packages by running:

`npm install`

You can make sure the project is ready to work on by running: 

`npm start`

## Install axios

Install axios into the project:
`npm install axios --save`


## Home view

Open the Home.js file in the components folder.
Import axios near the top of the file:
`import axios from 'axios';`
Now, you will make a `componentDidMount` method and use axios to make a GET request to the endpoint: `'/api/featured'`

Using the `.then` function on the axios call, set the `featured` property in state to the appropriate data in the results.

```javascript
componentDidMount(){
    axios.get('/api/featured').then(results=>{
        this.setState({
            featured: results.data
        })
    })
}
```

</details>

## Blog
Next we are going to add axios to the Blog.js component.

This axios request will also be in the `componentDidMount` method.

The enpoint will be at `/api/blog/:id`. The `:id` is a parameter. Meaning that the http request will send whatever is after the `/` as a varible to select the corresponding blog from the api. For example: `/api/blog/5` indicates to the api to get the blog with an id of `5`.

This parameter is being used in the React routing also. You can access the parameter in react thusly: `this.props.match.params.id` in this case.

Append the blog id to the api endpoint.

Assign the results to the `blog` property on state.

```
componentDidMount(){
    axios.get('/api/blog/${this.props.match.params.id}').then(results=>{
        this.setState({
            blog: results.data
        })
    })
}
```
